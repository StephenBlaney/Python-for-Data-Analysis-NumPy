# Python-for-Data-Analysis-NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:  a powerful N-dimensional array object sophisticated (broadcasting) functions tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions
This repsoitory contains a basic tutorial of the package along with sample numpy exercise and solutions ENJOY!!!!!!

It is highly recommended you install Python using the Anaconda distribution to make sure all underlying dependencies (such as Linear Algebra libraries) all sync up with the use of a conda install. If you have Anaconda, install NumPy by going to your terminal or command prompt and typing:

conda install numpy

If you do not have Anaconda and can not install it, please refer to Numpy's official documentation on various installation instructions.
